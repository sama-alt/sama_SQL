Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

Input Format

The following tables contain challenge data:

Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, and hacker_id is the id of the student who created the challenge.

Sample Output 1

12299 Rose 6

79345 Frank 4
80491 Patrick 3
81041 Lisa 1
Explanation

For Sample Case 0, we can get the following details:

Students  and  both created  challenges, but the maximum number of challenges created is  so these students are excluded from the result.

For Sample Case 1, we can get the following details:

Students  and  both created  challenges. Because  is the maximum number of challenges created, these students are included in the result.



Answer :
/*
Enter your query here.
*/
WITH Results AS (
SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name, COUNT(c.challenge_id) AS challenges
FROM Hackers h JOIN Challenges c ON h.hacker_id = c.hacker_id
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
),
Totals AS (
SELECT COUNT(hacker_id), challenges
FROM Results
GROUP BY challenges
HAVING COUNT(hacker_id) = 1
)

SELECT hacker_id, name, challenges 
FROM Results
WHERE challenges = (SELECT MAX(challenges) FROM Results) 
OR challenges IN (SELECT challenges FROM Totals)
ORDER BY challenges DESC, hacker_id ASC;
